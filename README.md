## Projects

### Airbnb Logistic Regression  
**[View Repo](https://github.com/tamannaiyyani/airbnb-logistic-regression)**  
This project builds and compares logistic regression models to predict booking behavior from Airbnb data. It focuses on model selection, evaluation metrics, and interpretability.

- Objectives: Feature engineering, model comparison using AIC/BIC/ROC
- Dataset: Airbnb guest/listing features
- Methods: Scikit-learn logistic regression, exploratory analysis
- Results: Best model chosen by interpretability and performance
- Files: Jupyter notebook, training dataset

### Book Review Sentiment Analysis  
**[View Repo](https://github.com/tamannaiyyani/book-review-sentiment-analysis)**  
This project classifies book review sentiment (positive or negative) using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization.

- Objectives: Frame and solve a binary text classification problem
- Dataset: Book review text with sentiment labels
- Methods: TF-IDF preprocessing, scikit-learn logistic regression
- Results: ~87% accuracy; confusion matrix and word frequency insights
- Files: Jupyter notebook and dataset

### Traffic Sensor Consensus Simulation  
**[View Repo](https://github.com/tamannaiyyani/traffic-sensor-consensus-simulation)**  
Simulates multi-agent consensus dynamics using Laplacian-based ODEs, with scenarios for noise and node crashes. Inspired by applications in traffic networks.

- Objectives: Model networked sensors achieving consensus
- Approach: Simulations with solve_ivp, Laplacian matrices, and network graphs
- Experiments: Normal convergence, crash at node 4, Gaussian noise on nodes
- Visualizations: 4+ output plots showing convergence and disruption
- Files: Python scripts, plots, and full project report PDF
